MQTT/UDP protocol Java implementation


  ru.dz.mqtt_udp.util.Sub	- Listen example
  ru.dz.mqtt_udp.util.Pub	- Send example

All the rest is library.

See also ../tools/viewer, simple visual MQTT/UDP traffic viewer written in Java.

BUILD

I am building this with Eclipse. There is build.xml included, but it also 
depends on Eclipse.
