Welcome and thank you for your intention to help me developing MQTT/UDP.

To help you here are links to some guides on how to set up your environment to contribute to the project.

In short all of them boil down to:

1. Fork, clone fork, setup clone to pull from original (my) repository and push to forked (your) repository.
2. Make it work on your computer. If it does not, ping me with bug reports, please.
3. Run tests and make sure tests complete successfully.
4. Fix bugs or write new code.
5. Document it or, at least, write release notes!
6. Test!
7. Make pull request with commits squished.

Now guides: 
*     Very short: <https://github.com/MarcDiethelm/contributing/blob/master/README.md>
*     Very detailed: <https://github.com/jonschlinkert/idiomatic-contributing>
*     Just right: <https://akrabat.com/the-beginners-guide-to-contributing-to-a-github-project/>
*     In Russian: <https://www.alexeykopytko.com/2018/github-contributor-guide/>

Last one is really detailed and compact, so maybe it is a good choice even for 
non-russian reader using some Google Translate, or other tool. Like this one: <https://translate.yandex.ru/translate>
