MQTT/UDP viewer is not just viewer anymore. It can send topic values now. Look at it:

New topic editor lets you learn topic names from network and set new
values. New values can be broadcast or sent to some MQTT/UDP host
directly. This is to use MQTT/UDP to configure sensors and other units
remotely.

Old functions are:

* Current state (last data sent) for all the topics
* Scrolling list of packets that come along
* List of sending hosts
