Fast track:

1. Go to tools/viewer, run mqtt_udp_view (you will need Java 8) - it will start visual MQTT/UDP traffic viewer.

2. Go to python3/examples and run random_to_udp.py  (you will need python 3.x) - it will start sending MQTT/UDP messages with random content. (If you love python 2.x, use python/... dir instead.

3. See viewer shows same data random_to_udp.py sends.

Congratulations, MQTT/UDP is basically working.

Now as you can both montior incoming traffic and generate outgoing, you can start embedding MQTT/UDP into your projects.
You have test environment set up.



You can also dump all traffic with:

  python/examples/listen.py 
  python3/examples/listen.py 
  lua/mqtt_sub.lua
  c/mqtt_udp_listen



You can also generate MQTT/UDP traffic with:

  python/mqttudp/pub.py
  python3/mqttudp/pub.py
  lua/mqtt_pub.lua
  c/mqtt_udp_pub

And (not from cmd line, though) even with:

  codesys/MQTT_UDP.EXP
  java ru.dz.mqtt_udp.util.Pub class
